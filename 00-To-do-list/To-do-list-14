Python script to practice CW log insight 
Check VPC flowlog and summary
Detailed to be populated later

Pre-requsites:
- VPC FLowlog has been enabled on VPC and logs have been shipped to CW log group
- Generate REJECT VPC logs
* Update SG in To-do-list-06, only allows inbound tcp/80, 443 from your VPC CIDR and you home ip
* Deploy/update To-do-list-06
* SSH to EC2 instance from your laptop to generate REJECT VPC FLowlog records for tcp/22
* Access the web server from your home laptop to generate  ACCEPT VPC Flowlog record for tcp/80
* Access non existance web url from your home laptop to generate 404 records for HTTP server
* Access the web server from your iPhone using 4G nework to generate REJECT VPC Flowlog record for tcp/80

Tasks:
1. From AWS CloudWatch Console, query VPC Flowlog
Reference filters:
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/working-with-flow-logs.html
[version, accountid, interfaceid, srcaddr, dstaddr, srcport, dstport, protocol, packets, bytes, start, end, action, logstatus]
https://medium.com/@crishantha/analyzing-aws-vpc-flow-logs-via-cloudwatch-logs-insight-and-athena-587c49246f7f
- Query ACCEPTed packets towards tcp/80 
- Query REJECTed packets towards tcp/80 
- Query REJECTed packets towards tcp/22

2. From AWS CloudWatch Console, query CW log apache-access-log to find out 404 access log

3. From AWS CloudWatch console, run CW insight query against VPC Flowlog group to summary (check out reference to CW query syntax)
- Source IP and destination ip address, destination network port of REJECT packet
- Source ip address and request summary to access HTTP server (destination ip: http server, port 80)

4. From AWS CloudWatch console, run CW insight query against apache-access-log 
- Source IP addresses and summary to access HTTP server
- URLs in 404 message
- Requests summary for each url 
- Top 5/10 popular URLs in access log

5. Python Script to automate either task 3 and/or task 4
  Required paramters: 
  - query period: last x days/hours
  Output:
  - CSV file which can be opened by Excel

Questions:
1. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/cloudwatch_limits_cwl.html
   Query results displayed in console
   By default, up to 1000 rows of query results are displayed on the console. You can use the limit command in a query to increase this to as many as 10,000 rows. For more information, see CloudWatch Logs Insights Query Syntax.
2. What if there are more than 10000+ records returned by CW insight?
3. Can we paginate CW Insight query?

Based on To-do-list-06 (CW agent)

1. Basic part: based on code To-do-list-06, install CW agent on Ec2 instance and ships apache logs to CW Logs group
2. Generate 404 log message to CW log group apache-access-log
- Spin up Apache server 
- Access any non-existance url using curl (or from your laptop) 
- SSH to apache server, run grep to ensure there are 404 records in access-log
  Example logs:
  127.0.0.1 - frank [10/Oct/2000:13:25:15 -0700] \"GET /index.html HTTP/1.0\" 404 1534
- Wait ~ 5 minutes until data is populated by CW agent to CW log groups, check there are 404 message in CW log groups
3. From AWS console, create customized CW metric urlNotFound

  Using Metric Filters to Extract Values from Space-Delimited Log Events 

  Log Group: apache-access-log
  
  Access any non-existance url using curl (or from your laptop), check whether CW metric urlNotFound is greater than 0
    
4. Automate step 3 using Terraform ( try to import resource created in step 3?)
  
   - update code To-do-list-06 
   - Run terraform apply to create CW filter and metrics
